		<header>What is it?</header>
		Backport of Holo Theme from Android 4.1 to 2.1.<br /> Your
		application can use a lot of new features on older platforms!<br /> <br />
		Modal choice mode for ListView? Easy!<br /> Dropdown popup for
		Spinner selector? Easy!<br /> Preference headers? Easy!<br /> <br />
		Just write code - we're stylize it.
	</div>
	<div class="node">
		<header>Addon's system</header>
		Remember those awful SherlockFragmentActivity, RoboguiceActivity or
		mega-hybrid: SlidingRoboguiceSherlockPreferenceActivity? <br />Put an
		end to this!<br /> <br />Now there's only Activity. It can attach to
		itself additional modules such as <a
			href="http://actionbarsherlock.com">ActionBarSherlock</a> or <a
			href="https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice">Roboguice</a>.<br />
		And no FragmentActivity - fragments support are everywhere - i.e. in
		ListActivity you can use DialogFragment, that was previously to be
		difficult with the support library.
